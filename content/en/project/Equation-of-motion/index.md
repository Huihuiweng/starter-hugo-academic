The dynamics of ruptures in 3-D dynamic rupture simulations can be well described by the following inertial equation-of-motion:

$F(G_c/G_0) = M(v_r) \cdot \dot{v}_r$

where $G_c$ is the fracture energy, $G_0$ is the static energy release rate, $v_r$ is the ruptuer speed, $\dot{v}_r$ is the rupture acceleration, $F()$ and $M()$ are the known "Force" and "Mass" terms.
